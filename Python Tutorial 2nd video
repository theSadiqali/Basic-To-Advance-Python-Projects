What is python?
Python is a versatile high level programming language. [you can use it in ( games, data science, Ai , machine learning , web development, hacking  etc) ]
& it known for its readbility and ease of use. and its very easy then other programming language.

why python?
versatile,  used in many ( just like web development, data science and ai machine learning and more )
eas of learning,  ( simple and easy )
high in demand,  (python developer are in high demand around the world, competitive salaries)
high salary,    ( Round about 80k dollar to 100k dollar in US) Mostly based on experience. intermediate level salary round about ( 80k to 140k ) .. if you have 10+ year experience range ( 150k dollar to 190k dollar )
