# - Python is like a toolbox with many tools inside, helping programmers work quickly and easily.
# - Many companies seek people who know Python because it's versatile and applicable in various job roles.

#let` Start coding 

print("Hello! Sadiq Ali")
#try it by yourself
#print differnet things like your name and hello world etc
#let me show u how you can save this 

#ctrl + S

#Comment:
"""single line comment and multiline comment
Actually python has different way to do comment. let me show you how you can do this. Multiline comment"""
#single line comment
"""Multi
line
comment"""

#Variable:
#In python variable are container to storing data values.

#just like this

x = 1
y = 2
z = 3
#ADDING
s = x+y+z   #storing in (s)
print(f"x VALUE: {x} ")
print(f"y VALUE: {y}")
print(f"z VALUE: {z}")
print(f"Result: {s}") 
#PYTHON IS SO SIMPLE AND EASY 

#let me tell you something interesting 
#VARIABLE ARE CASE SENSITIVE c and C 
#let me show you 
C = "SADIQ"
c = "sadiqali"
print(c)
print(C)
#and you know double qoutes and single qoutes are same 
m = "S"
m = 's'

#And we have legal variable and illegal variable in python 
myvar = "sadiq"
my_var = "sadiq"
_my_var = "sadiq"
MYVAR = "sadiq"
myvar1 = "sadiq"

#ILLEGAL VARIABLE 
"""1myvar = "sadiq"
my-var = "sadiq"
my var = "sadiq"""
print("\n\n\n")
#Many Values to Multiple variables 
#Actually allow you to assign values to multiple variables in one line.
names = "sadiq", "sadiq1", "sadiq2"
q, w, e = names
print (q)
print(w)
print(e)


#so now let me tell you about GLOBAL VARIABLE
#DO NO`T WORRY . WE WILL BE USING A SMALL FUNCTION, SO IT`S NOT A BIG DEAL. I WILL TEACH #YOU THAT LATER
#GLOBAL VARIABLE:
"""GLOBALE VARIABLE CAN BE USED BY EVERYONE, BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF A FUNCTION"""

def glbl():
    global abc
    abc = 'Alphabets'
    
glbl()

print(f"Global variable inside a function and outside a function: {abc}")
#For today its enough. I will teach you next python data types
